## Abstract:
This project presents an automatic face attendance system that utilizes facial recognition technology to mark attendance. The system captures images, extracts facial features, and verifies identity by comparing them with stored templates. Experimental results demonstrate the system's accuracy, efficiency, and security in tracking attendance, making it suitable for educational institutions, corporate offices, and government agencies.
